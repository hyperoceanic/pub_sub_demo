# PubSubDemo

This project shows how to do publish-to-the-server and subscribe-at-the-web-browser in Elixir. I wanted to understand this so I could use it in other projects.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
